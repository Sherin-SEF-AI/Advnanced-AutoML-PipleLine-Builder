# AutoML Pipeline Builder

## Overview

This project is an automated machine learning (AutoML) pipeline builder designed to streamline the process of data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation. It aims to make machine learning more accessible to data scientists and analysts of various experience levels.

## Features

- **Automated Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values and encodes categorical variables.
- **Task Type Detection**: Automatically detects whether the problem is classification or regression.
- **Feature Selection**: Identifies the most important features for the target variable.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Trains and compares multiple machine learning models.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Uses Optuna for optimizing model parameters.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Utilizes Plotly for creating interactive data visualizations.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies potential outliers in the dataset.
- **Data Drift Detection**: Monitors changes in data distribution between training and test sets.
- **Text Analysis**: Performs sentiment analysis and text clustering for textual data.
- **Model Interpretability**: Generates SHAP values for understanding feature importance.
- **AI-Powered Recommendations**: Integrates with Google's Gemini API for advanced insights.
